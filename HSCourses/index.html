        <tr><th>Course</th><th>Description</th>><tr>
        <tr class = "even"><td>Manufacturing Foundations</td><td><i>not found</i></td></tr>
        <tr class = "odd"><td>Robotics</td><Develop skills in several areas of Robotics, including mechanics, structure, assembly, software
programming, sensor electronics and motors. Students will also have opportunity to participate in Robotics competitions as part of this class.</td></tr>
        <tr class = "even"><td>Intro to Engineering Design</td><td>Learn the strategic steps used by engineers today in the “Engineering Design Process” and practice this design process by developing skills such as teamwork, brainstorming, 2-d and 3-d sketching, and the use of Solid Works 3D CAD software. Students will use an advanced 3-dimensional fast-prototype printer to create actual physical models of their designs. College credit available.</td></tr>
        <tr class = "odd"><td>Accounting 1</td><td>Students learn the concept of managing financial records for a sole proprietorship through recording business transitions, preparing financial statements, reconciling bank statements and operating a computerized accounting system. These skills are applicable to all business and personal financial activities. This class is highly recommended for all students interested in a career in business or enrolled in the Marketing program.</td></tr>
        <tr class = "even"><td>Graphic Arts 1</td><td>Explore the creative process using digital imaging software, photography, and a wide variety of image generating techniques. Develop drawing skills and build a portfolio using Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, In Design, and digital cameras.</td></tr>
        <tr class = "odd"><td>Microsoft IT Academy 1</td><td>Develop proficiency with Microsoft Word and PowerPoint software for school and workplace. Students may earn Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS) Certification upon successful completion of Microsoft exam. College credit available.</td></tr>
        <tr class = "even"><td>AP Calculus AB</td><td>Advanced Placement Calculus is a college-level calculus course. Students will develop an appreciation for calculus as a coherent body of knowledge and human accomplishment as they explore a multi-representational approach to calculus with concepts, results, and problems being expressed graphically, numerically, analytically, and verbally. Students will explore graphs, functions, limits, derivatives and integrals. Calculus is the mathematics of motion and an essential tool for college studies in physics, chemistry, biology, geology, medicine, business, economics, psychology, engineering, and computer science. The goal of this class is to introduce material so that students will be successful in college level calculus.</td></tr>
        <tr class = "odd"><td>Honors Chemistry</td><td>Honors Chemistry is a year-long laboratory-based science course devoted to understanding the
concepts and principles underlying chemical phenomena. This course covers the following topics: the particulate theory of matter, state of matter and change, specific chemical and physical properties, solutions, chemical reactions, stoichiometry, chemical bonding, atomic structure, periodicity, and nuclear process. Additional topics could include: organic chemistry, nomenclature, acids and bases, oxidation and reduction, modern atomic theory, and atmospheric chemistry. This course meets the algebra-based science course requirement for college entrance and meets one of the three science credits required for graduation.</td></tr>
        <tr class = "even"><td>AP Statistics</td><td>Advanced Placement (AP) Statistics is an excellent option for any secondary school student who has successfully completed a second-year course in algebra and who possesses sufficient mathematical maturity and quantitative reasoning ability. This course designed to introduce students to the major concepts and tools for collecting, analyzing, and drawing conclusions from data. Students will explore four broad conceptual themes: Exploring data (describing patterns and departures from patterns); Sampling and Experimentation (planning and conducting a survey); Anticipating Patterns (exploring random phenomena using probability and simulation); and Statistical Inference (estimating populations and testing hypotheses).</td></tr>
        <tr class = "odd"><td>AP Physics 1</td><td>AP Physics 1 is the equivalent to a first-semester college course in algebra-based physics; designed for students who are interested in pursuing careers in science, engineering, medicine or other similar fields. The course covers Newtonian mechanics (including rotational dynamics and angular momentum); work, energy, and power; and mechanical waves and sound. It will also introduce electric circuits. This course will prepare students to take the College Board’s AP exam in May. Students are strongly encouraged to take this test (requires a College Board fee of $91), with those scoring well enough having the potential to earn college credit.</td></tr>
        <tr class = "even"><td>Applied Engineering and Manufacturing</td><td>Learn to work with various manufacturing materials, safely operate aerospace machinery, use precision measurement tools, read blueprints, and apply accurate riveting practices by completing the Boeing Company’s industry recognized Core Plus curriculum. Students will gain an understanding of aerospace and other manufacturing careers, and develop a competitive edge in interviewing and applying for manufacturing jobs in our region. District bus transportation is provided. College credit available</td></tr>
